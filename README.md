# Recommendation Systems

Spending few weeks working on the idea/implementation of this project. Simply put the idea of this recommendation system is to implement practical models to recommend items based on users history logs. Ive used Apriori & FP-Growth to resemble Basket Analysis that can address the question is the user is interested in item (X) should I recommend item (Y) or something else. This analysis is based on performnce measurements starting from the confidence AKA accuracy, Support threshold w.r.t the life metric as well.
BTW Apriori & FP-Growth algorithms are consider Association Rules Mining these are heavily used by Amazon, Booking, Airlines, these platforms are built on using recommendation systems. **You can check the next image to understand the different startagies that drive $$$$ to these corporates.**

Additionally, I created an intro video "[Recommendation Systems Tutorial (Part One)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyiqVo7pf9I&ab_channel=TechTwinsforDataScience)" regarding Recommendation Models, just to give familiar insights about this undrerated topic.
